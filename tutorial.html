            <h1>How to study during Global Pandemic</h1>
            <h2>I decided to do a case study with a few students to give a better variety of ideas that work for some and might work for you. It is important to stay connected with friends and family to avoid the feeling of being isolated.</h2>

                           <p class="message">The nature of online studying means that I can be a bit more flexible with my timetable. I have learned to work during the hours where I am most productive. I have two planners- one for weekly and the other for daily tasks.</p>
                           <p class="message">The weekly one is useful because it allows me to see the bigger picture, whilst the daily one allows me to see each individual task in detail. At the start of the week I work on these plans and focus on the closest deadlines.</p>
                           <p class="message">I have found studying at home pretty difficult as I always like to study in cafes and libraries. To overcome this, I have found studying in different areas of the house to be useful as it switches things up a bit.</p>

                           <p class="message">I find it really hard to avoid distractions but I find setting fake deadlines puts more pressure on myself which makes me more productive. For example, setting an essay deadline one week before the real deadline.</p>
                           <p class="message">Another thing that helps is having someone working on something in the same room as you- if they’re focussed you’ll more likely to focus too.</p>
